# Single File Visual Studio C++ Console Application

## Overview
Welcome to the **Single File Visual Studio C++ Console Application** project! This project serves as a minimal yet robust template for quickly getting started with C++ development in Microsoft Visual Studio. The entire application is contained within one source file, making it easy to manage, customize, and expand.

## Features
- **Single File Implementation:** All source code is located in one file (`main.cpp`) for simplicity.
- **Visual Studio Compatibility:** Open, build, and run this project immediately using Microsoft Visual Studio.
- **Quick Setup:** Ideal for beginners and professionals who want a straightforward starting point for C++ console applications.
- **Extensible Template:** Use this project as a foundation for more complex applications.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project in Visual Studio:

### Prerequisites
- **Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later:** Ensure you have Visual Studio installed with the **C++ Desktop Development** workload.
- **Basic C++ Knowledge:** Familiarity with C++ and Visual Studio will help, though this template is beginner-friendly.

### Installation and Setup
1. **Download the Project:**
   - Download the project files from your repository, or copy the provided code into a new file.
2. **Create a New Project in Visual Studio:**
   - Open Microsoft Visual Studio.
   - Select **File → New → Project…**
   - Choose **Console App** under the C++ section.
   - Name your project (e.g., `SingleFileApp`) and select a location.
   - Click **Create**.
3. **Replace the Generated Code:**
   - In the new project, open the generated `main.cpp` file.
   - Replace its contents with the code provided in this project (or simply use this file as your `main.cpp`).
4. **Build and Run:**
   - Build the solution by selecting **Build → Build Solution** or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
   - Run the application using **Debug → Start Without Debugging** or pressing `Ctrl+F5`.
   - A console window should appear displaying the message:  
     `Hello, Visual Studio!`

## Project Structure
